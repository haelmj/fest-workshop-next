# next-demo

This is a demo on how to utilise [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) in Nextjs applications. This demo was delivered during the CBF fest as part of a technical workshop on "Securing Secret Keys in Frontend Applications"

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

*Prerequisites*:

- Ensure the following are installed:
    - Node
- Sign up to the API service [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
- Access your API keys [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)

# Setting Up

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/haelmj/fest-workshop-next.git`

2. Using a code editor, rename the *.env.example* file to *.env* and replace the text on the right side of the equal sign with your API Key.

3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
